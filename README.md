## About the Project
This virtual reality app was created in Unity and C# for the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree. The requirements for this included changing the provided components to modify button text and method  calls. 

## Enhancements
In my version, users start by viewing a winter holiday scene. By clicking a button, users venture to the darker side (literally) and view a spooky Halloween scene. Users can opt to use a flashlight to help them see in the dark. The button text on the UI changes based on the scene users are currently viewing. 

## Total Time
Total time spent on the project was about 3 hours. 

## Challenges and Reflection
One thing that was challenging for me was debugging a couple of issues I saw with the sun animation. For some reason, the sun would rise and set a couple of times when switching back to the main scene when it ran in Unity. When I tried to reproduce it on my phone and later in Unity, I couldn't figure out what was causing it because it suddenly started working again.

One thing that I'm really proud of are the particle effects I created for the cauldrons. I wanted to make them look like they were bubbling.

# HelloVRWorld by Kristin Dragos

This virtual reality app was created in Unity and C#. In it, users can view a winter holiday scene or venture to the darker side and view a spooky Halloween scene.

Total time spent on the project was about 3 hours. 

One thing that was challenging for me was debugging a couple of issues I saw with the sun animation. For some reason, the sun would rise and set a couple of times when switching back to the main scene when it ran in Unity. When I tried to reproduce it on my phone and later in Unity, I couldn't figure out what was causing it because it suddenly started working again.

One thing that I'm really proud of are the particle effects I created for the cauldrons. I wanted to make them look like they were bubbling.
